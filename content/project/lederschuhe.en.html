## Step 1: Prepare the pattern

<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0000.jpg") }}" alt="Bundschuh" title="Celtic leather shoes" class="project-img centered" />

Since I already had celtic shoes with I wanted to use as a pattern, I opened
the laces and laid a shoe flat on the table. Then I took a picture. I imported
the picture into a graphics tool (I used CorelDraw, but OpenSource Inkscape
should also work). First I tried to vectorize it automatically, but the result
didn't look good.

Then I put the picture in the background and draw the outline with the mouse; I
only placed a point at each corner, and then smoothed the lines (there is a
option for line objects; sorry that I cannot give the correct technical terms,
since I'm using the German version of the software). The second picture shows a
screenshot of the pattern drawing with the line option symbols.

In addition to the outline, I also drawed a little circle for a punch hole. And
then I cloned it multiple times and placed it at each hole location of the
photographed shoe.

Be sure to clone the circle and not to copy it. If you copy and change the
dimensions of one circle, all other circles remain the same. If you clone, you
can change all circles at once. I wanted to have a template that scales!

The final pattern (as DXF file and as PDF file) is available here:

<a href="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/schuh.dxf") }}">DXF pattern</a><br>
<a href="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/schuh.pdf") }}">PDF pattern</a>

To scale it, I looked up the length of the foot (for a 6 month old baby between
8-11 cm), and drawed two ellipses into the template to represent the foot. Then
I scaled the whole thing until the ellipses had the right size.

## Step 2: Prepare the laser cutter

<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0003.jpg") }}" alt="Leather cutting tests" title="Leather cutting tests" class="project-img centered" />

If you do not have a laser cutter, skip this step.

To cut something with a laser cutter, you first have two important things:

1. is it save to cut it? The laser beam will burn the material where it cuts.
You do not want to have poisonous smoke or explosions.

2. which settings?  The most important settings are speed (how fast does the
laser beam move) and intensity (how strong is it). If you use not enough power,
you might not cut the material. If you are to slow, you might get big burns at
the corners.

For 1., we were pretty sure that it should work, since leather is a natural
material, and many people use soldering iron to make designs in leather.
Nevertheless, since most leather was somehow colored, we had to be sure that
the color does not contain chlorine, which when burnt by the laser, creates a
gas that destroys the laserâ€™s mechanism. So, we took a small sample of each
leather and burned it with a lighter. There was no green light in the little
flame, so we think that there was no chlorine in the leather.

For 2., we tried out cutting a sample with different settings and noted them
down. The picture is not meant to be readable -- each laser cutter has its own
settings, and if you do not have one by yourself, ask the owner how to do this
step!

Leather can be cut pretty easily. On our 80W CO2 Laser we use the following
speed settings with 70% power:

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
	<tr><th>leather thickness</th><th>speed</th></tr>
	<tr><td>1.4 mm</td><td>100 m/s</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1.7 mm</td><td>70 m/s</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2.1 mm</td><td>50 m/s</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4.2 mm</td><td>25 m/s</td></tr>
</table>

## Step 3: Cut the leather

<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0004.jpg") }}" alt="First step" title="First step" class="project-img centered" />

To be honest, we did not cut the leather immediately - we tried it with
Polypropylen first (a plastic which is good to laser). So I produced two little
plastic shoes. Later, we tried to cut leather, but we forgot to re-focus the
laser cutter, so instead it produced brand design in the leather (right side of
the picture).

But then we lasered with the correct settings and produced two little leather
shoe forms including all the punch holes. This saves a lot of time in the last
step!

Leather is a nice material to cut. However, it really smells burned (well, it
is burned). So make sure that your exhaust system works properly.

The leather will smell, too. I used a cream colored leather and the cutting
edges all were pitch black. But then I washed the leather and let it dry; the
edges changed to a light brown, and after 3-4 days, the burned smell went away,
too.

If you do not have a laser cutter, you need sharp scissors and a hole punch.
You can print out the pattern and transfer it with a hard pencil on the
leather.

## Step 4: Final step: sew the shoes

<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0006.jpg") }}" alt="Sewing plan" title="Sewing plan" class="project-img centered" />
<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0007.jpg") }}" alt="Result (back)" title="Result (back)" class="project-img centered" />

To sew the shoes, you only need a thick needle and the draw string you want to
use. I used a silk band, but you can use other materials, too.

Sewing the front is easy (just a look, make sure that you enter each of the
lobs from the same side).

Sewing the back is a little bit more tricky. In the following scheme, "R1-A"
means "enter hole R1 from the outside", and R2-I means "enter hole R2 from the
inside" (outside means "aussen" in German, thus the 'A'):

R1-A R2-I N1-I M2-A L3-A L4-I M3-I R5-A R6-I L6-A L5-I N3-A R4-A R3-I N2-I M1-A L2-A L1-I

With this scheme, you get a nice cross stich on the back of the shoe. The two
ends of the string can be drawn inside, to make a knot there, which will be
partly hidden by the two sides (L1-L6/R1-R6).

## Step 5: Done!

<img src="{{ content_url("project/lederschuhe/0008.jpg") }}" alt="Baby with shoes" title="Baby with shoes" class="project-img centered" />

That's it!

To close the shoes, you could either attach a button on one side and make a
backstrap on the other; or you just do two strings with can be tied together.
And here you see little Ronja wearing a shoe for the first time in her life!
